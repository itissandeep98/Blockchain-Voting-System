# Ballot Box

A semi-decentralized & effective way of distributing rewards to workstream contributors.

With one list for the voters and another list for the candidates.

This build uses a Firebase data store for storing members and votes. The distribution creation and the votes are verified using signed messages. Then the distribution is done on-chain based on the information from the off-chain distribution.


## Local Development setup

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### 1. Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/itissandeep98/Blockchain-Voting-System.git
cd Blockchain-Voting-System
```

#### 2. Deploy contract on Hardhat:

```
```

#### 3. In a second terminal window, start your ðŸ“± frontend:

```bash
cd qd-off-chain-voters-and-candidates
yarn start
```

Copy your local burner wallet address (top right)

#### 4. Deploy your contract:

In `packages/hardhat/deploy/00_deploy_your_contract.js` paste your wallet address:

```js
const TO_ADDRESS = "YOUR_FRONTEND_ADDRESS";
```

You can also tweak the script (add test data, etc)

In a third terminal window, run:

```bash
cd qd-off-chain-voters-and-candidates
yarn deploy
```

#### 5. Run backend:

In a fourth terminal window, run the backend:

The project uses a local json file store as default.

You can switch to a Firebase (Firestore) data storage editing `packages/backend/services/db.js`. You'll need to create a firebase project and download the service account key configuration in your computer and set an environment variable with the path to that file (`export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="pathToServiceAccountKeyFile"`). You can generate and donwload the file in https://console.cloud.google.com/, under IAM & Admin > Service Accounts > Keys.

```bash
cd qd-off-chain-voters-and-candidates
yarn backend
```
